How this code works: if somebody submits a google form e.g I being user7 would respond to the form request through google sheets and would automatically send out an email to submitter and CC user1-user5 depending on the assigned region of submitted form once a decision has been made on a specific column.


note: Spreadsheet uses 3 tabs
First tab contains all submitted requests
Second tab has user1-user4 and their assigned regions(which can be moved around)
Third tab contains all templates with appropriate responses depending on decision
